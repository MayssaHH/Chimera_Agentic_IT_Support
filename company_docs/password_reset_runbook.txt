Title: Password Reset Guide (Employee Self-Service)
Version: 1.0
Effective: 2025-08-31

Scope:
This guide explains how employees reset their account password without IT changing it on their behalf.

Preconditions:
- Employee has access to corporate SSO login page
- MFA device (authenticator app or hardware key) is available

Steps:
1) Navigate to the Company SSO portal and click "Forgot Password".
2) Enter your corporate email and complete the CAPTCHA.
3) Choose MFA verification method (Authenticator push or security key).
4) Complete MFA. If MFA fails, open a ticket: category=Account, subcategory=MFA.
5) Create a new password that meets the policy:
   - Minimum 14 characters
   - At least 1 uppercase, 1 lowercase, 1 number, 1 symbol
   - Not part of the last 24 passwords
6) Confirm the new password and submit. Wait up to 2 minutes for propagation.
7) Re-login to SSO and verify access to Email, VPN, and core apps.
8) Update saved passwords in mail/mobile devices to avoid lockouts.

Notes:
- IT will never ask for your password.
- Reused passwords will be rejected by the directory policy.
- If you see an error 'password history violation', choose a different passphrase.
